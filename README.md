### The Problem:

The provided branch encountering two issues related to handling nullable fields (`Language?`) in the generated code.

#### Error 1:

When attempting to match products with a defined name, the code encounters a parsing/validation error. It fails to match the input value to any allowed input type for the `name` field, resulting in a type mismatch error.

#### Error 2:

The generated code lacks proper handling for equality checks (`equal(Null)`, `is(Null)`, `is_not(Null)`) for nullable fields. This omission is crucial, especially when dealing with nullable fields like `name`.
